# Gym-Capacity-Scraper
A Python scraper and analysis of RSF gym capacity trends at UC Berkeley to find the best workout times. 

## Overview
This is a project I undertook to scrape and analyze the capacity of the Berkeley Gym (RSF) over an extended time to find the best times to go to the gym. Through it I have determined the times in which the gym is the least full, and so I go during these times so that I can keep my workouts efficient.
